                <p>It is a beautiful, summer's day. The sun is shining on the lake and 600 children are running amok on the campus of Wellesley College. All is well and anticipation is in the air. Tonight is cruise night and all of the children are dressing up and freaking out about their dates (or lack thereof).</p>
                <p>Suddenly, the sound of 600 flash flood warnings ring out at once from the phones of every EXPLO student as lightning forks through the sky. The wailing of the children follows immediately. They know that their cruise night hangs in the balance.</p>
                <p>Will they still be able to sail the high seas with their friends?</p>
                <p>Will their carefully done hair and makeup be reduced to a puddle of streaky mascara and half-undone curls?</p>
                <p>Who can save them?</p>
                <p>Can anyone save them??</p>
                <p>Only one hero will do.</p>
                <p>The fabulous.</p>
                <p>The amazing.</p>
                <p>The heroic.</p>
