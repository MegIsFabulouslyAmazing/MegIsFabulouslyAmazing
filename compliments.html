            <p>Meg is a firework, okay like, you don't even know! Well, you probably do because she shines so bright like a diamon. Seriously, through - her personality isn't the only thing that sparkles... I mean, have you SEEN her luscious locks? It's like she bathed her hair in a tub of non-greasy vaseline. I love Meg because of her laugh and her sunny, yet professional disposition. She makes me feel so happy no matter what my mood is before talking to her. She makes people feel good because of her laughter and I could literally utter the words "pinky finger" and she'd giggle. She is a strong woman, and her students look up to this special lady. -Abby</p>
